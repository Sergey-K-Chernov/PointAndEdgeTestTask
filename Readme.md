This program has been written as a test task before a job interview.

The task
--------

Create N randomly distributed point on an XY coordinate plane. Every point is connected to a random K other points with edges. 
Implement a function to find the edge (R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>) nearest to a given point P.

### Input

N, K, P.

### Output

R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>

### Constraints

0 <= X, Y < 1000;

0 < K <= 5;

50 <= N <= 100;
